# SMART-HT: Smart Multi-level Adaptive Ranked Trie-Hash Model

## Project Overview
SMART-HT is an **Advanced Search and Indexing System** that efficiently indexes keywords using a **Trie** and retrieves documents using a **Hash Table**. This hybrid approach provides fast search, autocomplete suggestions, and adaptive ranking for text-based data.

## Features
- **Keyword Indexing using Trie**: Efficient storage and retrieval of keywords.
- **Document Retrieval using Hash Table**: Quick access to documents associated with keywords.
- **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Predicts possible keywords as you type.
- **Adaptive Ranked Search**: Returns relevant documents ranked based on frequency and relevance.
- **Multi-level Searching**: Combines Trie and Hashing for faster query results.

## Problem Statement
Traditional search systems are often slow in retrieving relevant documents from large datasets. SMART-HT addresses this by combining **Trie-based keyword indexing** with **Hash Table document retrieval**, enabling faster and more accurate searches.

## Motivation
The motivation behind SMART-HT is to improve the **efficiency of search operations** in large datasets. By using a hybrid model, the system reduces search time, provides ranked results, and improves the user experience in real-time search applications.
